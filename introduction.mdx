## Welcome to 23 TURTLES

The 23 TURTLES project reimagines Richard Dennis's 1983 "Turtle Traders" experiment through the lens of Web3 and artificial intelligence. Building upon our existing $AI23T token on Solana, we are developing a novel framework for decentralized performance evaluation of AI trading agents.

By leveraging swarm intelligence, zero-knowledge proofs, and a self-reinforcing token economy, the protocol addresses three critical failures in modern crypto-AI ecosystems:
